We present novel neural network architectures that significantly improve performance on computer vision tasks including object detection and image segmentation.

## Abstract

This paper introduces a new family of neural network architectures specifically designed for computer vision applications. Our approach combines the strengths of convolutional neural networks with attention mechanisms to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

## Key Contributions

- Novel attention-based architecture for visual processing
- Improved efficiency in object detection tasks
- Better performance on image segmentation benchmarks

## Results

Our method achieves:
- 5.2% improvement in mAP on COCO object detection
- 3.8% improvement in IoU on Cityscapes segmentation
- 40% reduction in computational complexity
